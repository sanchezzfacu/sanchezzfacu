# Hi, I am Facundo Sanchez 👋

## 🚀 About me
I'm a frontend developer looking for my first IT experience and I feel prepared to reach it.
Developing user interfaces is where I have found my passion and that's the reason why I'm currently developing my frontend skills. 
I'm very passionate about technology and knowledge, so I'm constantly learning new things not necessarily related to coding.


## 🛠 Skills
JavaScript, React, Redux, CSS, SASS, GIT, HTML, PostgreSQL, Node, Sequelize, Express.
